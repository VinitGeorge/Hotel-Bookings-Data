**Project Description**: Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis
**Business Problem**:
In recent years, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced high cancellation rates, leading to significant issues such as reduced revenue and suboptimal room utilization. The primary goal for both hotels is to reduce cancellation rates to improve revenue efficiency. This project aims to provide thorough business advice to address this problem by analyzing hotel booking cancellations and other factors affecting their business and yearly revenue generation.

**Assumptions**:

No unusual occurrences between 2015 and 2017 have significantly impacted the data used.
The information is current and applicable for analyzing hotel strategies effectively.
There are no unforeseen negative consequences of implementing the advised techniques.
The hotels are not currently using any of the suggested solutions.
The most significant factor affecting revenue efficiency is booking cancellations.
Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked duration.
Clients cancel reservations in the same year they make them.
**Research Questions**:

What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
How can we reduce hotel reservation cancellations?
How can hotels improve their pricing and promotional decisions?
**Hypotheses**:

Higher prices lead to more cancellations.
Longer waiting lists increase the likelihood of cancellations.
Most clients make reservations through offline travel agents.
**Analysis and Findings**:

The analysis shows that 37% of reservations are canceled, significantly impacting hotel revenue.
City hotels have more bookings compared to resort hotels, possibly due to cost differences.
Average daily rates for city hotels are often lower than resort hotels, particularly on weekends and holidays.
August has the highest number of confirmed and canceled reservations, while January has the most canceled reservations.
Cancellations are more frequent when prices are highest.
Portugal has the highest number of reservation cancellations.
Online travel agencies account for 46% of reservations, while groups account for 27%. Only 4% of clients book directly.
**Suggestions**:

Pricing Strategy: Lower rates or provide discounts to reduce cancellations.
Resort Hotel Discounts: Offer reasonable discounts on room prices during weekends or holidays.
Marketing Campaigns: Launch campaigns in January to increase revenue during the month with the highest cancellations.
Improve Quality: Enhance hotel quality and services in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
This project involves comprehensive data analysis to understand and address the factors contributing to hotel booking cancellations, providing actionable insights to improve hotel revenue and efficiency

**MY WAY OF STORY TELLING**

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e96ef80-1662-42e1-b96b-88f38072be53)
The above visualization is created for the Average Daily Rate (adr) for both Resort and City Hotels VS Reservation Status Date. From 2016 to 2017 , the data is uniform , identifying it as a period of stable and reliable data that is suitable for further analysis thus removing the inconsistencies.
 
What are the vizualisation we can see here is
1) The adr of city hotel is running between the adr of resort hotel
2) the data from 2016-2017 is more reliable and uniform
Why do we observe some spikes?
Spikes we are observing are nothing but the pricing variations at the weekends occuring because the people start going for sightseeing, vising places, so demands gets higher so charges for hotels may change.

Here the city hotels price in comparison with resort hotel  is less at a particular time and at a particular time more.

The hypothesis what I imagined and what was kept in my mind is proving that city hotels price is lesser compared to resort hotel for some days; day can be holidays and weekends.

Lets see how the reservation status looks like in terms of month


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b02dd939-358f-4f9d-937d-040b13c70423)

- First month, January is having the most cancellations and least in August 
- Reservation is peaked at the same month August and least in December and January

 The insights what we are getting is bit confusing.

- When cancellations are least, the reservation is most
- When the cancellations are most, the reservation is least

What does this mean?
1) Is price in August was less, is this the reason for having least cancelation?
2) Is price in August was higher that resulted in more cancelations?

LET's PLOT THE AVEREAGE DAILY RATE FOR EACH MONTH

What I  was checking here is pricing has any effect on cancelation, and the data I'm looking forward is for the canceled dataframes

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8120e6b5-cec5-4e87-aca1-724554345dc0)

- ADR is least in August
- ADR is highest in January
          When cancelations are higher, higher is the price . Hence it proves the hypothesis

CANCELATION RATE BASED ON COUNTRIES

Observing the top 10 countries having the most cancelations

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b652c780-8145-4450-8e52-7fa9661ed9ea)


Portugal contributes 70.07% among 10 countries for the most cancelation

SUGGESTIONS

- Improve the hotel facilities
- Pricing should be in a fair manner/ should be reduced
- Should give Promotional discounts
- Run campaigns 
-  Advertisement and Marketing

CHECKING WHETHER THE CANCELATIONS ON ADR FOR PRICE IS HIGH COMPARED TO NON CANCELED ONES


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fd2c1f8-79b6-45e3-9929-ea61c33d053c)

There are some inconsistencies in the data, I'm filtering the data from 2016-2017 September, and using these data to plot. For which I get the graph as follows 


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bce27c6-704b-40e5-becc-bcc648460e1f)

- Again its a proof that price has effect on cancelation
- ADR is the factor that is mostly influencing the cancelation rate
- As you see, higher the ADR, higher is the cancelation; lower is the ADR for non canceled ones
